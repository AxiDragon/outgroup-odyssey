			<h2>TO SUMMARIZE</h2>

				<li>Outgroup homogeneity bias refers to the tendency to underestimate
					the differences among members of a group to which we do not belong.</li>
				<li>One cause of outgroup homogeneity bias is that it's easier for our brain to
					think that an outgroup consists	of all the same sorts of people.</li>
				<li>Outgroup homogeneity bias can lead to people from outgroups
					being perceived as less competent or friendly.</li>
				<li>When you find yourself falling into the trap of outgroup homogeneity
					bias, find commonalities with the other person,
					creating a new ingroup that includes both you and the other person.<br />
					Rather than looking at what divides you, look at what unites you.</li>
