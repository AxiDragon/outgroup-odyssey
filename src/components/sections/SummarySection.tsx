				<li>Outgroup homogeneity bias refers to the tendency to underestimate

				<li>Outgroup homogeneity bias can lead to people from outgroups
					being perceived as less competent or friendly.</li>
				<li>When you find yourself falling into the trap of outgroup homogeneity
					bias, find commonalities with the other person,
					creating a new ingroup that includes both you and the other person.<br />
					Rather than looking at what divides you, look at what unites you.</li>
